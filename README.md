Sx is a library for creating declarative interfaces to imperative APIs.

For building interfaces, this approach has already proven great success in frontend libraries like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) â€“ it allows you to think of your application as a (pure) representation of its current state, while your application code consists of functions that map between state and UI elements.

There have been various attempts to bring the same concepts to native platforms, e.g. [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

The name Sx was loosely inspired by [**s**ymbolic e**x**pressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) and the fact that this library compliments well with [Rx](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).

Sx was heavily inspired by React and I want thank the development team for their work, the effort to develop it in the open and especially for the outstanding [implementation notes](https://reactjs.org/docs/implementation-notes.html).
